        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Joanna and I am passionate about web development! I have graduated with a BEng in robotics however
            I fell love in full stack development - both front end and back end - this passion has woken up a deep desire to
            change directions and fully embrace the path of a full stack developer. I love creating websites, making it as versitile
            and accessable as possible, using the latest technologies. I am still learning and I enjoy every second of it! I am
            looking forward to work on website development related projects. Due to my background in robotics I will offer a sharp, mathematical
            mind focused on finding the most optimal solution.
