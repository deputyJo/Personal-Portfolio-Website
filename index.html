    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Joanna, and I am passionate about web development! Although I graduated with a BEng in Robotics, I fell in love with 
            full-stack development—both front-end and back-end. This newfound passion has ignited a deep desire in me to change directions and 
            fully embrace the path of a full-stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>I love creating websites, striving to make them as versatile and accessible as 
            possible, using the latest technologies. I am still learning and enjoying every second of it! I am eager to work on website 
            development projects. My background in robotics gives me a sharp, mathematical mind, focused on finding the most optimal solutions.</p>
